st.write("It will take effort by all of us to achieve a future with clean energy and clean transportation. Some of the policies, technologies, and actions that can help are described below. As we move to a more sustainable society, we’ll need big thinkers, inventors, researchers, and policymakers to develop solutions")

st.write("Our first step is to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change. We need to use more clean energy – and use that energy more efficiently — to power everything from our cell phones to our homes, offices, and factories. We need to drive cars and trucks that use less gasoline or run on electricity or other alternative fuels. Everyone can play a part, including students and teachers.")
