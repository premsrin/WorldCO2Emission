# WorldCO2Emission

Global warming is the current rise in temperature of the air and ocean. The present global warming is mostly because of people burning things, like gasoline for cars and natural gas to keep houses warm. But the heat from the burning itself only makes the world a tiny bit warmer: it is the carbon dioxide from the burning which is the biggest part of the problem. Among greenhouse gases, the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the main cause of global warming.

Among greenhouse gases, the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the main cause of global warming. As you see below, CO2 constitutes 65% of the Global Greenhouse house emissions.

We can see from the graphs that world co2 emission has been increasing rapidly from 1900

We can see from the graphs that there is a steep increase in CO2 emission of China from 1980. CO2 emission in United Kingdom is not increasing over the last few years.This reduction in co2 emission seems to be due to the Climate Change Act established by the UK government.
